[intro]
[Ooooooooooh!]

      Amaj               Amaj
Whose woods these are, I think I know

        Emaj            Emaj
but his house is in the village, so

   E7               E7
he will not mind me stopping here

        Amaj                 Amaj
just to watch his woods fill up with snow.


            Amaj               Amaj
You know my lit-tle horse must think it's weird

   Emaj            Emaj
to stop with-out a farmhouse near

   E7                  E7
be-tween the woods and frozen lake

       Amaj            Amaj
on the darkest evening of the year.

      Amaj               Amaj
So he gives those jingle bells a shake

        Emaj            Emaj
just to ask if there is some mistake

    E7         E7
the only other sound's the beat

   Amaj               Amaj
of Rock & Roll with an ole snow flake
